# Chrono Divide API Playground

This is a sample project that uses the [Chrono Divide Game API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chronodivide/game-api). It can be used to develop and test AI bots for [Chrono Divide](https://chronodivide.com)] by running the game headless, in an isolated command-line environment. The API can create offline games between computer-controlled agents, or even online games, played in real-time versus human opponents.
